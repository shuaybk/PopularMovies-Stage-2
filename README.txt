For the code to work, you need to enter an API Key from themoviedb.org (I removed mine).

The API_KEY String constant is defined in line 43 of MainActivity.java.  Replace the empty string with your API_KEY and build the project.


Example filled in API_KEY (line 28):
public static final String API_KEY = "111111aa11a11a1a11a1111aaaaa11a1";  //themoviedb.org API Key, replace with your own to make this app work
